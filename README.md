# Audio Synth

This audio synth allows user to visualize and play music.

We have given you some starter code that provides the following building blocks for building your music synthesizer:

- `Signal`: a sound wave with a specific shape, amplitude, and frequency.
- `Waveform`: the _shape_ of a sound wave, independent of amplitude and frequency. You can ask a `Waveform` to generate a `Signal` at a specific frequency.
- `AudioBuffer`: an arbitrary sound that is made of many individual amplitude measurements. An `AudioBuffer` could potentially contain many different waveforms at different times. You can play an `AudioBuffer` to your computer‚Äôs speakers.

Here a more detailed explanation of each of these concepts:

### Signal

A ‚Äúsignal‚Äù is any quantity that varies over time. In the case of this program, the quantity that varies is the amplitude of a wave, and the signal represents sound.

A signal can be _any_ specific sound. If the sound is a wave, then it would be a wave with a specific amplitude and frequency. Each of these images depicts a different signal:

See the [`Signal`](src/audiosynth/Signal.java) interface for more information.

This simple interface is already complete; you won‚Äôt need to change it.

### Waveform

A ‚Äúwaveform‚Äù is the general _shape_ of a wave, independent of frequency, amplitude, or phase. For example:

- ‚Äúsine wave‚Äù is a waveform, while
- ‚Äúsine wave with amplitude 2 and wavelength 3‚Äù is a signal.

In this project, we given you a [`Waveform`](src/audiosynth/waveform/Waveform.java) interface with [several different implementations](src/audiosynth/waveform/). Each class that implements `Waveform` can generate signals for different wavelengths (and thus for different musical pitches):

These different `Waveform` implementations all compute the signal using a formula in a lambda expression, much like the graphing calculator activity.

These implementations are all already complete and correct. Note how small a useful class can be!

### AudioBuffer

In computer science, the word ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù¬†means ‚Äúplace where we can temporarily store a bunch of data while we are working with it.‚Äù In this case, the buffer stores sound data.

Unlike the waveforms, which the code computes using mathematical formulas, an [`AudioBuffer`](src/audiosynth/AudioBuffer.java) contains **sampled audio:** arbitrary sound data expressed as specific numbers, in this case an array of floats. Each number in the array represents the amplitude at one moment in time, and the different array indices represent time steps of 1/48000th of a second. This is called **discrete sampling**.

This kind of sampled audio is how modern computers‚Äô sound chips represent sound data. To play a signal as sound through your computer‚Äôs speakers, you must covert it to sample data:

The code in `AudioBuffer` is all correct, and the class is _almost_ complete; you will add just one method to it.

### Try it out!

We have given you a little code that renders just one signal to an `AudioBuffer`. Try running the `AudioSynth` class, and you should hear a sine tone through your computer‚Äôs speakers.

See if you can figure out how to change the:

- ‚úÖ pitch,
- ‚úÖ duration, and
- ‚úÖ waveform.

Enjoy! üéµ
